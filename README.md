# 🍹 SCADA-Controlled Cocktail Production Simulation

A Citect SCADA 7.10 project simulating an automated cocktail production system with real-time monitoring, alarms, and trend tracking.

## 📌 Features
- Real-time simulation of cocktail production (Margarita, Whiskey Sour, Daiquiri)
- Cicode scripting for mixing logic, temperature monitoring, and motor control
- Alarm and trend systems for fluid levels and motor temperature
- Multi-screen HMI interface with user access control for refilling operations

## 🛠 Technologies
- Citect SCADA 7.10  
- Cicode (custom logic scripting)  
- HMI design and tag-based process control

## 🤝 Collaboration
This project was developed as a solo student project.
